'''THIS IS A MOTION DETECTING PROGRAM FOR THE RASPBERRY PI

It is part of a tutorial series that you can find here:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlg8lN4r9qWiDzF13lJY-lGtiTFHHGcpx

Running this program requires installing SimpleCV as well as
a few other prerequisits on your pi. You can find detailed
instructions for how to do that here:
